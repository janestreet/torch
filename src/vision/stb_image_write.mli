(*####################*)
(** {1 Image writing} *)

(** [buffer] simply is an alias to a bigarray with c_layout. Two kind of pixel buffers are
    manipulated:
    - int8 for images with 8-bit channels
    - float32 for images with floating point channels

    Content of an image with [c] channels of width [w] and height [h] is represented as a
    contiguous sequence of items such that:
    - channels are interleaved
    - each pixel is made of [c] items
    - each line is made of [w] pixels
    - image is made of [h] lines *)
