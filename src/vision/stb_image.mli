(*##############################*)
(** {1 Image representation} *)

(** [buffer] simply is an alias to a bigarray with c_layout. The [buffer] type serves two
    purposes:
    - representing input files,
    - representing the raw pixels of an image.

    Two kind of pixel buffers are manipulated:
    - int8 for images with 8-bit channels
    - float32 for images with floating point channels *)
type 'kind buffer = ('a, 'b, c_layout) Array1.t constraint 'kind = ('a, 'b) kind

type float32 = (float, float32_elt) kind
type int8 = (int, int8_unsigned_elt) kind

(** A record describing an image. The buffer contains [channels * width * height] items,
    in this order:
    - channels are interleaved
    - each pixel is made of [channels] items
    - each line is made of [width] pixels
    - image is made of [height] lines *)
type 'kind t = private
  { width : int
  ; height : int
  ; channels : int
  ; offset : int
  ; stride : int
  ; data : 'kind buffer
  }

(** {2 Creating image} *)

val image
  :  width:int
  -> height:int
  -> channels:int
  -> ?offset:int
  -> ?stride:int
  -> 'kind buffer
  -> 'kind t result

(** {2 Image accessors} *)

val width : _ t -> int
val height : _ t -> int
val channels : _ t -> int
val data : 'kind t -> 'kind buffer

(** {1 Image decoding} *)

(** Load an 8-bit per channel image from a filename. If [channels] is specified, it has to
    be between 1 and 4 and the decoded image will be processed to have the requested
    number of channels. *)
val load : ?channels:int -> string -> int8 t result

(** Load a floating point channel image from a filename. See [load] for [channels]
    parameter. *)
val loadf : ?channels:int -> string -> float32 t result

(** Decode an 8-bit per channel image from a buffer. See [load] for [channels] parameter. *)
val decode : ?channels:int -> _ buffer -> int8 t result

(** Decode a floating point channel image from a buffer. See [load] for [channels]
    parameter. *)
val decodef : ?channels:int -> _ buffer -> float32 t result

(** {2 Low-level interface}

    Functions are similar to the above one, except memory is not managed by OCaml GC. It
    has to be released explicitly with [free_unmanaged] function.

    You get slightly faster load times, more deterministic memory use and more
    responsibility. Use at your own risk! *)

val load_unmanaged : ?channels:int -> string -> int8 t result
val loadf_unmanaged : ?channels:int -> string -> float32 t result
val decode_unmanaged : ?channels:int -> _ buffer -> int8 t result
val decodef_unmanaged : ?channels:int -> _ buffer -> float32 t result
val free_unmanaged : _ t -> unit

(** {2 Image filtering} *)

(** Generate one level of mipmap: downsample image half in each dimension. In
    [mipmap imgin imgout]:
    - imgout.channels must be imgin.channels
    - imgout.width must be imgin.width / 2
    - imgout.height must be imgin.height / 2
    - imgout.data will be filled with downsampled imgin.data *)
val mipmap : int8 t -> int8 t -> unit

(** Downsample floating point images. See [mipmap]. *)
val mipmapf : float32 t -> float32 t -> unit

(** Flip the image vertically *)
val vflip : int8 t -> unit

(** Flip the image vertically *)
val vflipf : float32 t -> unit

(** Blur the image *)
val expblur : int8 t -> radius:float -> unit
