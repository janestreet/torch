(* TODO: also save optimizer states. *)

(** [loop ~start_index ~end_index ~var_stores ~checkpoint_base f] starts a loop ranging
    from [start_index] to [end_index]. On each iteration [f] is called on the current
    index.

    This loop is checkpointed: regularly the state of all the elements of [var_stores] are
    saved on disk to file checkpoint_baseXXX. If such files already exist when starting
    the loop, the last one of this file is used to restore the variables content. *)
